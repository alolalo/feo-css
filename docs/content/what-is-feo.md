_Feo_ is a tiny SCSS framework based on [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) from [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/piccalilli_). In essence, it is a _utility-enabled_ and _utility-first_ framework.

## Core principles

Compared to other frameworks, _Feo_ distinguishes itself by focusing on a few core principles:

- **Custom properties**: all configured design tokens are converted into CSS custom properties that can be changed in runtime. In addition, all utility classes point towards these custom properties, instead of using the SCSS variables during compile time.
- **Layout driven**: a lot of the issues we face are all about layout. And CSS is good in layout. _Feo_ offers several standardized layout solutions that can be altered using additional utility classes for these layouts.

## Write your own CSS

Next to these core principles, _Feo_ encourages you to **write your own CSS**. _Feo_ does not solve everything, it might barely hit 80% of you CSS problems. But it standardizes common problems and common styles and abstracts these away. This allows you to focus on the real issues you need to solve that differ from project to project.

## What does Feo stand for?

Nothing really. At one point my wife was gaming and a character on the screen that caught my eye was called 'Feo Ul'. However, I read it as 'Feo UI', and I liked it. Later it hit me that I was reading it wrong, but the name stuck with me.
